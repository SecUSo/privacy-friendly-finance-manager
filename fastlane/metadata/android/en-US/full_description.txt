The privacy friendly Finance Manager helps you keep track of your income and expenses.

The app offers the following features:

- New transactions
You can create new expenses by clicking on the Plus-Button in the bottom right corner in the main view. Now you can enter the amount, a title, a date and a category. Furthermore, you can specify if the transaction is an expense or income.
- Transaction overview
In the main view you are able to see the total balance of your transactions, as well as a list with all transactions you entered. By long-clicking on the entry you can either edit or delete the transaction.
- Categories
Under the menu item “Categories” you can see all the categories you created and their total balances, depending on the transactions that are labelled with the respective category. By clicking on the Plus-Button in the bottom right corner you can create new Categories. By long-clicking on the entry you can either edit or delete the category.
